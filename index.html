                  <p id="about-section">
                      I have been active with faith-based ceremony work for over ten years.
                      In 2003 I completed MLA’s Leadership Training Program in Sapphire Canyon,
                      Colorado, and have served several times as a Guide with The Berkshire Men’s Circle.
                      I have gone on to study Rites Of Passage work such as participating in Vision Fast
                      ceremonies with the School of Lost Borders in Big Pine, California,
                      and serving on staff with the Men’s Leadership Alliance in Eldora, Colorado.
                      I am also a registered officiant with the State of New York and a
                      trained Life and Career Coach. I will work with you to craft a ceremony
                      that speaks to your faith, focusing the words of your ceremony towards
                      the intention of your commitment. Deeply rooted in community, passion,
                       and spirit, I offer an inclusive and joyful presence for your wedding celebration!</p>

            <h4>Individual Coaching</h4>
                  <p>You’re caught in traffic or sitting at your desk, looking out at the sunshine. Or, perhaps you’re reading an inspiring book. You hear that voice, small yet insistent. <i>Where is the life of my dreams? How can I be excited about my life again? </i></p>
                  <p>My coaching uses a one-on-one dynamic as the foundation of the work we will do together to get to the heart of breakthroughs in your human experience. No one can reach that breakthrough alone.</p>
                  <p>Coaching provides a nurturing space that invites you to peel back the layers of your past and present and investigate the heart and soul of your questioning.</p>
                  <p>Coaching is a conversation that turns your desires into action plans toward your future. Our sessions combine the philosophical and pragmatic elements inherent in any life shift, building a strong foundation to hold what arises as you take your first steps down new paths.</p>

                  <h5>What is possible?</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Recognize learned patterns</li>
                    <li>Examine limiting views</li>
                    <li>Let go of perceptions that block growth</li>
                    <li>Create a vision for yourself and your life</li>
                    <li>Develop action plans to achieve your vision</li>
                    <li>Set goals rooted in time and responsibility</li>
                    <li>Embrace joy and ease</li>

                  <h4>Executive, Team, & Business Coaching</h4>
                    <p>Coaching at the executive, team, and business level takes place onsite at your organization. We take on the conversations of intention, action, and accountability across the organization and within each individual.</p>
                    <p>The coaching process challenges us to examine the values, modes of operating, and visions of the collective. You are invited to declare who you wish to be – in the industry and the workplace – with the goal of creating action plans that sustain the processes and dynamics that support these declarations.</p>
                    <p>I start by creating the space that opens us up to developing and sharing our declarations. The space is safe but not too safe. Confidentiality is key. Next, I immerse myself in your corporate culture and I interview decision-makers and the executive team, and we flesh out statements of intent for our time together.</p>
